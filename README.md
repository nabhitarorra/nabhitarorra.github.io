## Projects
### Library Management System | LibraLogix
[Publication](https://github.com/nabhitarorra/Library-Management)

Designed and developed “LibraLogix,” a comprehensive library management system using Java, focusing on efficient management of book inventory and user transactions. The system is implemented with advanced object-oriented programming techniques to handle real-world library operations such as book checkouts, returns, renewals, and fines. Utilizing a dynamic cataloging system, it enables precise tracking and management of books by title, author, and category, enhancing the user’s ability to quickly locate and manage resources.

The system also integrates user account management, supporting permissions, and transaction histories, which facilitates a personalized and secure user experience. The implementation of a serialized file system for account data storage ensures data persistence across sessions. This project highlights the utility of Java in developing robust applications that require handling complex data structures and providing real-time user feedback and interaction. The library system serves as a model for scalable software architecture, potentially adaptable to larger scale digital library systems or integrated into existing educational institution management software.

### Formula 1 Qualifying Dynamics | Impact on Race Outcomes
[Publication](https://github.com/nabhitarorra/F1-Race-Outcome-Analysis)

This project utilizes a robust statistical approach to explore the significant impact of qualifying positions on Formula 1 race outcomes, using R and its suite of packages including tidyverse, ggplot2, and broom. The analysis employs sophisticated data wrangling techniques to clean and merge large datasets, facilitating a detailed examination of the correlation between drivers’ starting positions and their finishing ranks in races.

The study leverages multiple regression analysis to quantify how starting near the pole position can predict better race results, adjusting for various race day variables like driver status and incidents. Visual representations such as scatter plots and boxplots provide intuitive insights into data trends, with regression models further confirming the predictive power of qualifying positions.

This data-driven investigation highlights the strategic importance of qualifying sessions in Formula 1, suggesting that teams could gain a competitive edge by focusing on optimizing their qualifying strategies. The findings also suggest potential areas for further research, including the effects of external variables like weather conditions and team strategies, which could enhance understanding of their impact on race dynamics. The project demonstrates a comprehensive application of statistical modeling to decode complex relationships within sports analytics, offering actionable insights for race strategists and enthusiasts.
